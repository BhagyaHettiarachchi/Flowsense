Perform comprehensive model evaluation using multiple metrics (RMSE, MAE, R¬≤, MAPE, Explained Variance)

Compare model performance across accuracy, computational efficiency, and stability

Visualize prediction accuracy and provide deep comparative analysis

Demonstrate ITS relevance and software reliability
